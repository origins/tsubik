Finally I've found some time to refresh my personal website. Nothing changed here for a years and the blog was already dead. Even if I liked old design of my website I decided to change it definitely. It was looking too darkly, too gloomy and had many unnecessary graphics elements which could be swapped by simple text using proper fonts. The next problem was lack of support for mobile devices, the page was not adapting to device screen at all.

<p>
As I am a web developer I've decided not to use any CMS solution to build me site. Going further I've decided my website to be completely static html site.
</p>
<p>
So I've made a list of requirement to meet. My site must:
</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Be static and easily to modify.<br/>
To meet this I am using Jekyll tool built in Ruby. This is static site generation tool, allowing you to use layouts, templates and many nice features. Building site with Jekyll could be topic for another blog post, I do not want to describe here, you can check out code of my site on github.
</li>
	<li>
	Have responsive design to adopt to mobile devices screens.
	</li>
	<li>
	Be bright, simple without any unnecessary fireworks.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I think I met these requirements so I hope you like me new design. Enjoy.
